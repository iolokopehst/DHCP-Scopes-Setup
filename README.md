# DHCP Scopes Setup

This PowerShell script automates **DHCP server setup and scope creation** on a Windows Server. It is designed for lab and demo environments to quickly provision multiple DHCP scopes, configure scope options, and authorize the DHCP server in Active Directory.

---

## What the Script Does

1. **Installs the DHCP Server role** if it is not already installed.  
2. **Prompts for user input**:
   - Number of DHCP scopes to create  
   - Base subnet (e.g., `192.168.1`)  
   - Default gateway for the scopes (optional)  
   - For each scope:  
     - Scope name  
     - Start IP suffix  
     - End IP suffix  
     - Subnet mask  
3. **Creates all scopes** on the DHCP server.  
4. **Sets scope options**:  
   - Default gateway (if provided)  
   - DNS server (automatically set to the serverâ€™s IP)  
5. **Authorizes the DHCP server** in Active Directory.  

After the script finishes, the DHCP server is fully configured and ready to serve clients.
